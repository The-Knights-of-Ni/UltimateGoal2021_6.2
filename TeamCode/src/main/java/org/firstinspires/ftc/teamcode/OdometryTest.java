/*
 * This is an example LinearOpMode that shows how to use the digital inputs and outputs on the
 * the Modern Robotics Device Interface Module.  In addition, it shows how to use the Red and Blue LED
 *
 * This op mode assumes that there is a Device Interface Module attached, named 'dim'.
 * On this DIM there is a digital input named 'digin' and an output named 'digout'
 *
 * To fully exercise this sample, connect pin 3 of the digin connector to pin 3 of the digout.
 * Note: Pin 1 is indicated by the black stripe, so pin 3 is at the opposite end.
 *
 * The X button on the gamepad will be used to activate the digital output pin.
 * The Red/Blue LED will be used to indicate the state of the digital input pin.
 * Blue = false (0V), Red = true (5V)
 * If the two pins are linked, the gamepad will change the LED color.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
